# Audio Training Game

## Interactive Frontend Project - Code Institute

[The Interval Training Game](shinners888.github.io/audiogame/)


A simple game to test aural skills by guessing the intervals between two notes

Features include:
- randomised sound files of two notes, with the option of hearing them again
- 5 possible points for each interval. 1 point lost for each wrong answer
- Can be played by anyone - developed for people looking to improve or maintain aural skills

## Goals

This is a simple aural testing and training game. Repeated use will build aural skills over time. Constant practise is key to building strong aural skills. A game can build confidence by providing positive feedback on achieving the correct answer. This in turn can encourage people to keep trying and get better.

The target customer is anyone looking to build aural skills. The layout is simple and easy to naviagte regardless of musical knowledge or age.

## UX

The game is aimed at everyone. It helps to be an English speaker as the website and interval options are in English. However, as the layout is intuitive and simple to navigate, it would be easy to figure out, especially for musically trained non-english speakers.

## The Site - Features

The site/game is a single page.
There are:
- a start button
- a repeat button (to hear the last interval again)
- a 'next' button
- a score counter
- 12 buttons representing each interval options

Settings:
- a volume button
- a toggle to choose harmonic or melodic intervals
- a hints sheet for how to play, and how to recognise different intervals

## WIREFRAMES

[Mobile](/workspace/AudioGame/assets/wireframes/mobileWireframe.png)

The final game layout differs slightly from the wireframes. Volume control was not a possibility, and it became imperative during the development of the game that the user pick the interval type before game play. Therefore, there is now a 'Load Game' modal that pops up before the game, where these options can be located.

## Gameplay
1. On game load, choose whether to listen to melodic or harmonic intervals.
2. On start, press play and two notes will sound.
3. Pick from the 12 possible answers below.
4. If incorrect, the button goes red and you lose a point. Try again.
5. If correct, the button goes green and you gain 5 points.
