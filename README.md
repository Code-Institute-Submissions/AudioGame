# Audio Training Game

## Interactive Frontend Project - Code Institute

A simple game to test aural skills by guessing the intervals between two notes

Features include:
- randomised sound files of two notes, with the option of hearing them again
- 5 possible points for each interval. 1 point lost for each wrong answer
- Can be played by anyone - people looking to increase aural skills or maintain their ear

## Goals.

This is a simple aural testing and training game as repeated use will build aural skills over time. Constant practise is key to building strong aural skills. A game can build confidence by providing positive feedback on achieving the correct answer. This in turn can encourage people to keep trying and get better.

The target customer is anyone looking to build aural skills. The layout is simple and easy to naviagte regardless of musical knowledge or age.

## UX

The site is aimed at everyone. It helps to be an English speaker as the website and interval options are in English. However, They are laid out smallest interval to largest. As this is an intuitive layout, it would be easy to figure out, especially for musically trained non-english speakers.

# The Site - Features

The site/game is a single page.
There are:
- a start button
- a repeat button (to hear the last interval again)
- a 'next' button
- a score counter
- 12 buttons representing each interval options

Settings:
- a volume button
- a toggle to choose harmonic or melodic intervals
- a hints sheet for how to play, and how to recognise different intervals
